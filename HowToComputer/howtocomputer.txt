==== HOW DO I USE THE COMPUTER? ====
Here's a brief summary of active projects, where they are, and what I'll need to reinstall if I ever nuke Windows. 

++++++ EXAMPLE HEADER
Example text.
  REPO: This text will be green. This can be changed in startup.ps1.
  COMMAND: This text will be green.
  USERNAME: This text will be green.
  
++++++ HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS OPEN ON STARTUP?
This opens on startup because I told Task Scheduler to open it when I log in.
The PS script is at \Startup Files\startup.ps1. All code sampled is cited in comments there.

++++++ PERSONAL SITE
Hugo v0.124 is running on a Ubuntu 22.04 x64 server at 0.0.0.0. The static site is hosted using Github Pages.
  REPO: example.github.io
I'm following this guide: https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
The domain will be website.com, which is rented via namecheap

++++++ SSH INTO A SERVER
The server is at 0.0.0.0 currently, and I can ssh in via Powershell using 
  COMMAND: ssh user@0.0.0.0
or from another Ubuntu device using
  COMMAND: ssh user@0.0.0.0
  USERNAME can be found in KeePassXC.
Once the domain is set up, I should be able to remote in using
  COMMAND: ssh user@domain.com
